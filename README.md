# E-Cars App
E-Cars App is a simple command-line application written in C for managing car rentals. It allows users to consult the availability of cars at an agency and provides a detailed history of rentals on a daily, monthly, and overall basis. The app archives these histories for future reference.

## Project Background

This project was created as part of my first-year computer science engineering studies at ENSI during the C programming course. It was designed to apply the concepts learned in class and develop practical programming skills.
